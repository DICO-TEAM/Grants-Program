## Project Overview

The `DICO` is to create a decentralized and governable ICO platform for the Polkadot/Kusama ecology. Our platform will allow entrepreneurs to quickly find investors. In a word: Be a platform to link ideas and capital.

### Overview

Our platform offers a few key features:

* *KYC*: Includes identity authentication service(IAS), KYC users, and supervisor. responsible for providing users with a decentralized KYC certification service.
* *ICO*: Apply for ICO and council review for the project party.
* *DAO*: Strict control of the progress and process of the project.
* *Swap*: Provide an exchange agreement for tokens and an interest-generating method for collateralized tokens into the liquidity pool for disposable tokens
* *Oracle*: Provide an oracle for the platform.

Our project use substrate framework and is built on top of Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem:

* *KYC*,*ICO*,*DAO* and *Swap* modules are built on substrate runtime. they complete the basic user interaction logic.
* *Oracle* enabled off-chain worker to query the current price feed of  the platform or other tokens.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

> We are aiming to offer the first decentralized KYC/ICO  in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

> To start with, our target audience are the DICO/DOT/KSM/other tokens holders who are looking to participate in ICO project. and the team funded through ICO.at this stage, we will provide a KYC area for legal regional ICO. next， we provide derivatives related to ICO. Such as providing token exchange and staking protocol. at this stage, allow any token holders to participate in their promising projects. in addition,We will go to support or self-improve all the required ecology, such as social. finally, we provide stable project maintenance and update functions that keep pace with the times, and serve the entire ecological stability.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

> Be a platform to link ideas and capital.


* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  * If so, how is your project different? *coinlist*，A token financing platform, all the mainstream virtual currencies above can be traded and financed. It provides token financing, but does not provide the funds needed by early creator and the control of the entire project cycle.

  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? We have not yet found a project that will be focusing ICO and derivatives.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
* academic publications relevant to the problem,
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
